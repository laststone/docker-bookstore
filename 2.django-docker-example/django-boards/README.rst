django-boards/punkweb
=====================

Django forum boards with bbcode support.

Demo/Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check out our community at `PunkWeb <https://punkweb.us/board/>`__ for a
live demonstration of django-boards, or view the
`documentation <https://punkweb.us/board/page/docs-index/>`__!

A note about sceditor (BBCode editor)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to keep this repository clean I am not including the source for
the bbcode editor in the static assets folder.

I may make a separate repository for the bbcode editor, as I plan to
hack it to fit special needs for this project.

For now, download `SCEditor <http://www.sceditor.com/>`__ and unzip it
at: ``django-boards/static/sceditor/``

Supported BBCode tags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click `here <https://punkweb.us/board/page/supported-bbcodes/>`__ to see
a list of all the supported BBCode tags on django-boards and how to use
them.

Almost ready for use!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check out the 'Ready' milestone under issues to see what's left before
this is at a usable state.
